# Oracle-journey
That's my journey to get the Oracle Cloud Data Management Foundation </br>
*Less time on maintenance, more time for data innovation*

## Oracle Autonomous Database Services
Oracle as different offers about Oracle Database:
- On-premises Database: Fully managed by User/Customer
- DBCS (Database Cloud Service)
- Exadata (Exadata Cloud Service)
- ADP (Autonomous Database Service): Fully Managed by Oracle. Lower cost. 
- Third-party cloud
Bewtween On-premises Services and ADP, it has a service call a Co-Managed Service, where Oracle manages the infrastructure and the user/customer manages the database

## Manual Migration to ADP using *Data Pump*
There're few databases stystems that Oracle doesn't support. So Data Pump is a tool to solve it. 
It's pretty simple to use, in few steps we can do that:
1. Run the Could Premigration Advisor Tool (CPAT).
2. Export on-premises database using Data Pump.
3. Transfer exported dump files to Object Storage.
4. Import into Autonomous Database using Data Pump.
### Tools that are supported by Oracle 

# APEX - Application Express
APEX is the Oracle low-code tool which make it simple and fast to create data-driven apps.
It could be at last 10x (up to 50x) faster than traditional coding.
It has really nice toold to analyse and visualize.
Also it's fully automated from Oracle, it means we don't have to anything about connection or state management, everything is made by Oracle.

# Oracle Cloud Infrastructre (OCI)
A short review from infrastructure to 
1. Infrastructure: "Foundation".
2. Databases, Data & AI: Databases need to have a home and of course it has to be a safe one.
3. Aplications & Analytics.
Through everything we still have Governance & Administration and Developer Services.
Altough the basis are Cloud regions, Cloud@Customer, Hybrid Cloud and Multi-Cloud.
Summarizing this topic, OCI allows us to Store, Access, Govern and Analyze our Data.
